# Brokkr's baremetall pre-built-tools 
A fine Selection of various software that can be executed either within the container or plucked out from the container directory /brokkr for a closer to the "metal" experience. 

# Why
I found myself recompiling some of these tools over and over for sometimes old/airgapped production system either for error search or single fix/demo/performance test. Now I'm adding software that I want to explore or utilize.

DO NOT USE MY BUILDS FOR YOUR PRODUCTION· Altough the respective software project is the finest  of sorts , it doesnt mean my builds/build scripts make them justice. You must also check that respective License. For Redhat/Rhel builds im using UBI which is/was most permissive.
